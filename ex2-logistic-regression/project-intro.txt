There are two projects under this directory. In the first project, I developed a logistic regression model to predict whether a
students gets admitted into a university, given the applicant's scores on two exams. In the second project, I developed a logistic
regression model to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA), given a dataset of test
results on past microchips, and I added in regularization terms to avoid over-fitting risk.

The first project is summerized in the file ex2.m. 

Historical data from previous applicants about their exams scores and whether they got admitted was used as the training set, given in
the file ex2data1.txt, and can be visualized by calling the code in the file plotData.m. 

The code in the file costFunction.m calculated the logistic regression cost function (without regularization) by calling the sigmoid
function in the file sigmoid.m. The parameters of the regression model were determined by calling fminunc function which minimized
the logistic regression cost function with regards to the training set (the code is included in the file ex2.m). Once the parameters
were determined, these values were used by the code in the file plotDecisionBoundary.m to plot a boundary between two classies of data
(admitted v.s. not admitted). And the model can be used to predict whether a particular student will be admitted. For example, for a
student with an Exam 1 score of 45 and an Exam 2 score of 85, an admission probability of 0.776 was obtained.

The code in the file ex2.m also calculated the prediction accuracy of the classifier with regards to the training set. A training 
accuracy of 89% was achieved.

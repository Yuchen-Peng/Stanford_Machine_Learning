There are two projects under this directory. In the first project, I developed a logistic regression model to predict whether a
students gets admitted into a university, given the applicant's scores on two exams. In the second project, I developed a logistic
regression model to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA), given a dataset of test
results on past microchips, and I added in regularization terms to avoid over-fitting risk.

The first project is summerized in the file ex2.m. Historical data from previous applicants about their exams scores and whether they
got admitted was used as the training set, given in the file ex2data1.txt, and can be visualized by calling the code in the file
plotData.m.

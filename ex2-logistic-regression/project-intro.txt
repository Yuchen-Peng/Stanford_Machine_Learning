There are two projects under this directory. In the first project, I developed a logistic regression model to predict whether a
students gets admitted into a university, given the applicant's scores on two exams. In the second project, I developed a logistic
regression model to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA), given a dataset of test
results on past microchips, and I added in regularization terms to avoid over-fitting risk.

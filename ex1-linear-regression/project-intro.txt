In this project, I developed a linear regression model to predit profit for a restaurant franchise's new outlet, with the data for
profits of the chains old outlets in various cities and populations from the cities (stored in file 'ex1data1.txt') given as the
training set. The data set was visualized by executing the file ex8.m.

To determine the parameters of the regression model, I applied gradient descent algorithm on the training set such that the cost
function was minimized. The cost function was written in the file computeCost.m. And code in the file gradientDescent.m applied
gradient descent on the training set while computing the cost by calling computeCost.m in each iteration.

For population = 35,000, the model predicted a profit of 4519.767868.

For population = 70,000, the model predicted a profit of 45342.450129.

The result of this project is summerized by running the file ex8.m.

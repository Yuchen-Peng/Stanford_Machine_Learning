In this project, I developed a linear regression model to predit profit for a restaurant franchise's new outlet, with the data for
profits of the chains old outlets in various cities and populations from the cities (stored in file 'ex1data1.txt') given as the
training set.

To determine the parameters of the regression model, I applied gradient descent algorithm on the training set such that the cost
function was minimized.

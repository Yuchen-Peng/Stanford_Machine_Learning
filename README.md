# machine-learning-projects
My solutions to the programming projects of Stanford's machine learning class taught by Andrew Ng on Coursera. The solutions are written using Matlab.

Projects include:

(1) Linear regression model: Developed a linear regression model to predict the profit of a restaurant franchise given the populations of cities; the parameters of the regression model were determined by applying the gradient descent algorithm.

(2) Logistic regression model: i. Developed a logistic regression model to predict whether a students gets admitted into a university, given the applicant's scores on two exams. ii. Developed a logistic regression model to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA), given a dataset of test results on past microchips; added in regularization terms to avoid over-fitting risk.

(3) Neural network model: Developed a neural network model to recognize handwritten digits; the parameters of the model were determined using forward and backward propagation algorithm.

(4) Regularization problem: Developed a regularized polynomial regression model to predict the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir; the regularization term parameter was determined such that the cost with regard to the cross-validation data set was minimized.

(5) Support vector machine (SVM) model: Developed an SVM model to build a spam filters which classified emails into spam and non-spam email with high accuracy.

(6) K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Applied K-means algorithm for image compression; applied PCA to perform dimensionality reduction on a dataset of 5000 face images.

(7) Anomaly detection: Implemented an anomaly detection algorithm to detect servers with failing risk on a network.

(8) Recommender system: Developed a movie rating system by implementing the collaborative filtering learning algorithm.
